## Hi I'm Manuel and welcome to my github account! 👋
### Software Developer | Musician | AI & Healthcare Enthusiast

### About me 😄 
I am Manuel Garcia (He/Him), a Software Developer/Musician eager to learn about how IT and programming can help humanity! My goal is that by learning 🔭 how to implement AI/ML in the Healthcare field, I want to give people a better, affordable, and top notch preventative care service ✚! Currently working in a ML specialization at Coursera, ideas for automation over preventative care, and a RPG game!

### Some facts about Myself 😎

- 🚀 Trying to find ideas on how to improve preventative care and diagnosis for humanity! If you have any ideas please contact me!
